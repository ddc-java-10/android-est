## Summary

_EST_ is an application based on Android which makes it convenient for a user to search for and keep 
track of living organisms. The application provides information about a species such
as endangerment status, habitat, numbers, etc.

## Intended users &amp; user stories

* People who are concerned about life on the planet

> As someone who loves animals, I want a way to easily look up information about any particular animal

* People who are in positions which require them to keep up on the status of endangered species

> As someone who acts on behalf of vulnerable species, I want access to up-to-date information 
regarding the status of a given species of animal, plant, etc.
