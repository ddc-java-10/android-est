## Summary

_EST_ is an application based on Android which makes it convenient for a user to search for and keep 
track of living organisms. The application provides information about a species such
as endangerment status, habitat, numbers, etc.

## Intended users &amp; user stories

* People who are concerned about life on the planet

> As someone who loves animals, I want a way to easily look up information about any particular animal

* People who are in positions which require them to keep up on the status of endangered species

> As someone who acts on behalf of vulnerable species, I want access to up-to-date information 
regarding the status of a given species of animal, plant, etc.

* **Functionality**

    * The user will be able to search for information about an organism by common name or scientific 
name. A pop-up or a new page will display the relevant information and, if available, an image.
    
    * The user can search by endangerment status. The result screen displays a list of organisms under 
that status. Each item is linked for easy navigation to a chosen species.

    * A history button will be available for the user to have access to the species that had been
already searched.

* *Device or external services used*

    * [IUCN Red List API](https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/)
    * [Endangered Animals API](https://endangeredanimals.docs.apiary.io/#)
    * [Species API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/species)

    * Google Sign In

## Possible enhancements

* Use a map service, such as google-maps, to display the regions of the planet where the species 
currently inhabits.

* Use a social networking service so that information can easily be shared.
